GAME SCRIPT FOR THE SHIT THE CHARACTERS SAY
they're all scarecrows, they're all wistful for the things they cannot do, they all know the player character, who has been to visit them repeatedly

[[TITLE IDEAS]]
    One Ticket to the Lonely Soul Scarecrow Show

[[RANTS, GENERALLY SPEAKING]]
    the maze is not a good place for the scarecrows to be, and I want this to be communicated as implicitly as possible
    the priority here is to convey a feeling for the space, not to make a carefully-directed critique of society (though that will probably happen naturally)

    1. (v) what hope is there in struggling against an overwhelming power?
        the deck is stacked against us, and the rules change as soon as they can be construed to help us
        this isn't a storybook or fairytale
        we have no path forward, we have no idea what to do
    2. (v) what's the difference between being rooted and being trapped?
        they say we have free will, but it's not like we can get down off of these wooden poles
        they say we have everything we need, and that there's nothing for us out there, so what's the harm in letting us go look?
    3. (^) there's nothing better than sharing a meal with friends and family
        it can be a crucial break from the fast-paced modern world
    4. (^) are we only meant to do the things we're good at?
        why should we seek to optimize our qualities?
        people should have autonomy to do what interests them
        there's nothing wrong with doing what you're good at either
        the pressure to optimize is artificial and dehumanizing
    5. (^) what happens to us after we're no longer here?
        it's scary
        even if someone is no longer here, they're only truly gone after they've been forgotten
        this doesn't keep loss from hurting, it only makes it more bearable
    6. (v) manipulative breakdown - 'you're being selfish for not depending on me'
    7. (v) why didn't my hard work pay off in the end? what was the point?
    8. (^) know any good jokes?
        things may not always be good, but we've always got each other
        spreading joy is the best way to make the most of a bad situation
    9. (<>) self insert
    10. (v) do you even know what they do to us here?

IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER!
[[SCARECROW 1]]
    jovial, hospitable, welcoming, passive-aggressive
    [1] (bright, cheerful) Hello! Welcome back.
    [2] I hope you enjoy your time with us.
    [3] Please let me know if you need anything.
    [4] I would be happy to assist you.
    [5] (conspiratorially) By the way, did you happen to bring what I asked for?
    [6] (yes) (overjoyed) Oh, marvelous, thank you, thank you! This will keep those pesky bugs off my face. No respite from them out here, I'm afraid. Well, enjoy your journey!
    [7] (no - RANT) (resigned) Ah. Well, not to worry. I understand you have your own responsibilities (video fades in background), and may not necessarily have the time for a simple scarecrow such as myself. Certainly no one would think twice about prioritizing the needs of flesh and blood humans over that of a scarecrow. (bla bla bla...guilt trip stuff...the camera slowly zooms on the video and the scarecrow, fading out everything else...until it suddenly snaps back into place) But goodness, how I do prattle on. Please, enjoy the rest of your journey. And remember: (sickly sweet) we are at your service.
[[SCARECROW 2]]
    lonely, uncertain, eeyore, kind
    [1] (dully) Oh, hello there. Thanks for coming to see me.
    [2] I know I'm not the one you're here to see, but it's nice that you dropped by all the same.
    [3] It's been kind of quiet lately, not many people come through these days.
    [4] I've kind of come to expect it, though.
    [5] We were made to scare things away, after all.
    [6] . . .
    [7] Do you think that we have an obligation to do the things we're good at?
    [8] (yes) Oh...sure, I guess that just makes sense. Uh, thank you for chatting with me.
    [9] (no - RANT)
[[SCARECROW 3]]
    sleepy, hungry, satisfied, gluttonous
    (crows perched, picking at the scrow)
    [1] (lazily) I...thought I heard someone...mmm...thrashing about out there.
    [2] I didn't...mmm...realize...that it was you. It has been...quite some time.
    [3] You look as...delicious as ever.
    [4] Tell me, are you...[grunts]...eating well?
    [5] (yes - RANT)
    [6] (no) Oh, oh...hmm...well, that is...too bad. I hope for more...delectable feasts in your future.
[[SCARECROW 4]]
    grandstanding, magnanimous, self-absorbed, out of touch
    [1] Hellllo! How wonderful it is to see your shining face once again.
    [2] How long has it been? I am shocked that you could stay parted from me for so long! [hearty laugh]
    [3] No need to be shy! You are more than welcome to stay and bask in my radiant glow for as long as you like.
    [4] After all, I don't maintain this brilliant visage simply for my health! [hearty laugh]
    [5] (uncharacteristically tender) You...will stay a while, won't you?
    [6] (yes - RANT)
    [7] (no) Oh ho! As a matter of fact, I just remembered I have a pressing appointment I simply cannot miss. Though it stings my heart, we will have to have our tête-à-tête another time! Ta ta for now!
[[SCARECROW 5]]
    concerned, well-intentioned, manipulative, controlling
    [1] Hey! Are you feeling better?
    [2] I was thinking more about what we talked about last time.
    [3] I think you're just overthinking things.
    [4] Either way, I'm glad you came to me.
    [5] The other residents are a little...well, you know.
    [6] They don't know you like I do.
    [7] So, do you need more help?
    [8] (yes) Oh, dear, dear, of course. I will listen for as long as you need.
    [9] (no - RANT)
[[SCARECROW 6]]
    mischievous, generous, good-natured, carefree
    [1] Oh, just the person I was hoping to see today!
    [2] Just yesterday, I came up with a real gut-buster.
    [3] Okay, here we go: why don't scarecrows need to eat?
    [4] . . .
    [5] Because we're already stuffed! Ha ha ha!
    [6] What about you? Got a good joke for me?
    [7] (yes - RANT)
    [8] (no) Ah, no problem! It's hard to be as naturally funny as I am, after all, ha ha ha! Good to see you, have fun out there!
[[SCARECROW 7]]
    me
    [1] Hey! It's me, Jeff, the developer.
    [2] You're moving through the maze pretty well.
    [3] You'll probably be finished before long.
    [4] Anyway, just wanted to check in and say thanks for playing.
    [5] I'm a small-time game dev, so it means a lot that you took the time to play.
    [6] What do you think? Are you having fun so far?
    [7] (yes) Oh, great! I wasn't sure anyone besides me was going to like this game by the time it was finished. That means more than I can tell you, thank you. Enjoy the rest of the game!
    [8] (no) Ah, I'm sorry to hear it. If you want to duck out early, you can press the [quit keybind] key to quit. Otherwise, I hope it gets better from here.
[[SCARECROW 8]]
    austere, no-nonsense, supportive, indecisive
    [1] (brusquely) Welcome!
    [2] You're doing an adequate job traversing the maze.
    [3] No need to stop and chat with me.
    [4] Though...rest and hydration are both important as well.
    [5] So also feel free to take a break now and then!
    [6] (sheepishly) Uh...sorry. I'm still new at this.
    [7] It can be tough learning the ropes, don't you think?
    [8] (yes) Yes, you get it! Thanks for your support. Keep up the good work!
    [9] (no - RANT)
[[SCARECROW 9]]
    despondent, heartbroken, hopeful, desperate
    (dug up earth next to the scrow)
    [1] (angrily) Hey y- (disappointed) Oh. It's just you.
    [2] Ah, sorry, I don't mean it like that, it's just that, well...
    [3] I mean, you can see...they dug up Nell and took them away.
    [4] I just really miss them. (sniffs)
    [5] I know that's just how things go out here sometimes, but I can't help it.
    [6] Nell really was one-of-a-kind.
    [7] Do you think I'll see them again?
    [8] (yes - RANT)
    [9] (no) Right...well, all I can do is look to the future and hope for the best. Thanks for hearing me out.
[[SCARECROW 10]]
    inviting, teasing, irresponsible, fun-loving
    [1] Whoa, look who it is!
    [2] Great to see you - too bad the weather isn't better, huh?
    [3] Maybe we can do something about that... (sun moves to set behind)
    [4] There we go, that's much better. (giggle)
    [5] You're pretty close to the end now, but I'm glad you stopped to see me first.
    [6] How are you? Is everything okay?
    [7] (yes - RANT)
    [8] (no - RANT)

[[BARKS]]
    "I think I'm still somewhere near the entrance..."
    "I'm near the eastern wall right now"
    "I think I'm close to the northern edge of the maze"
    "This is the western wall, I think"
    "Looks like I'm getting to close to the exit now"
    "I'm near the center of the maze at this point"
    (specific barks for each scarecrow, letting the player know they're in the room or nearby, and whether the dialogue has been exhausted or not)
