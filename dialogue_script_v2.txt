GAME SCRIPT FOR THE SHIT THE CHARACTERS SAY
they're all scarecrows, they're all wistful for the things they cannot do, they all know the player character, who has been to visit them repeatedly

    One Ticket to the Lonely Soul Scarecrow Show

[[RANTS, GENERALLY SPEAKING]]
    the maze is not a good place for the scarecrows to be, and I want this to be communicated as implicitly as possible
    the priority here is to convey a feeling for the space, not to make a carefully-directed critique of society (though that will probably happen naturally)

    1. what hope is there in struggling against an overwhelming power?
        they're making me do things i don't like, but i don't have any other options
        the deck is stacked against us, and the rules change as soon as they can be construed to help us
        this isn't a storybook or fairytale
        we have no path forward, we have no idea what to do
    2. what's the difference between being rooted and being trapped?
        they say we have free will, but it's not like we can get down off of these wooden poles
        they say we have everything we need, and that there's nothing for us out there, so what's the harm in letting us go look?
    3. there's nothing better than sharing a meal with friends and family
        it can be a crucial break from the fast-paced modern world
        life can be a struggle, but it's impossible to struggle all the time
    4. are we only meant to do the things we're good at?
        why should we seek to optimize our qualities?
        people should have autonomy to do what interests them
        there's nothing wrong with doing what you're good at either
        the pressure to optimize is artificial and dehumanizing
    5. what happens to us after we're no longer here?
        it's scary
        even if someone is no longer here, they're only truly gone after they've been forgotten
        this doesn't keep loss from hurting, it only makes it more bearable
    6. manipulative breakdown - 'you're being selfish for not depending on me'
        i'm not like the others - only i understand you
        i'm not doing this for me, i'm doing it for you - you need me
        you should be grateful - if anything, you're being selfish for not opening up to me
        don't i have a right to know what's going on? don't i deserve to know how you're feeling? you owe me that
    7. why didn't my hard work pay off in the end? what was the point?
        it's so discouraging
        i could have saved myself a world of hurt by simply not trying
        how do i keep going after this?
    8. know any good jokes?
        things may not always be good, but we've always got each other
        spreading joy is the best way to make the most of a bad situation
    9. do you even know what they do to us here?
        why do you think we can "talk"? how do you think we scare crows away?
        you walk through here all the time, for a good time, but you never ask if we're okay
        are you trying to keep your head in the sand?
        don't kid yourself - this is a zoo, and we're stuck in the cages
        the wizard of oz is damaging anti-scrow propaganda
    10. are you willing to set aside your privilege to help us?
        like, i'm glad you can hear us, but that doesn't improve our situation
        you have no incentive to act, but will you anyway?
        are we your friends or your entertainment?
        you're just like everybody else
    11. more sinister self-insert
        i interrupt and talk over another scrow as i inhabit its mind, otherwise pretty similar to the original idea
    12. if i have the option to leave, why would i stay?
        do i have a responsibility to fix the problems here?
        do i have a responsibility for my friends and family who cannot leave? who will not leave?
    13. it's our fault things are like this, not our oppressors
        our personal responsibility must outweigh the effects of the system
        if we do better, our situation will improve, it has to

[[BARKS]]
    "I think I'm still somewhere near the entrance..."
    "I'm near the eastern wall right now"
    "I think I'm close to the northern edge of the maze"
    "This is the western wall, I think"
    "Looks like I'm getting to close to the exit now"
    "I'm near the center of the maze at this point"
    (specific barks for each scarecrow, letting the player know they're in the room or nearby, and whether the dialogue has been exhausted or not)
