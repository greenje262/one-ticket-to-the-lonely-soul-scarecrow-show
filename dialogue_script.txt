GAME SCRIPT FOR THE SHIT THE CHARACTERS SAY
they're all scarecrows, they're all wistful for the things they cannot do, they all know the player character, who has been to visit them repeatedly

IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER!
[[SCARECROW 1]]
    jovial, hospitable, welcoming, passive-aggressive
    [1] (bright, cheerful) Hello! Welcome back.
    [2] I hope you enjoy your time with us.
    [3] Please let me know if you need anything.
    [4] I would be happy to assist you.
    [5] (conspiratorially) By the way, did you happen to bring what I asked for?
    [6] (yes) (overjoyed) Oh, marvelous, thank you, thank you! This will keep those pesky bugs off my face. No respite from them out here, I'm afraid. Well, enjoy your journey!
    [7] (no - RANT) (resigned) Ah. Well, not to worry. I understand you have your own responsibilities (video fades in background), and may not necessarily have the time for a simple scarecrow such as myself. Certainly no one would think twice about prioritizing the needs of flesh and blood humans over that of a scarecrow. (bla bla bla...guilt trip stuff...the camera slowly zooms on the video and the scarecrow, fading out everything else...until it suddenly snaps back into place) But goodness, how I do prattle on. Please, enjoy the rest of your journey. And remember: (sickly sweet) we are at your service.
[[SCARECROW 2]]
    lonely, uncertain, eeyore, kind
    [1] (dully) Oh, hello there. Thanks for coming to see me.
    [2] I know I'm not the one you're here to see, but it's nice that you dropped by all the same.
    [3] It's been kind of quiet lately, not many people come through these days.
    [4] I've kind of come to expect it, though.
    [5] We were made to scare things away, after all.
    [6] . . .
    [7] Do you think that we have an obligation to do the things we're good at?
    [8] (yes) Oh...sure, I guess that just makes sense. Uh, thank you for chatting with me.
    [9] (no - RANT)
[[SCARECROW 3]]
    sleepy, hungry, satisfied, gluttonous
    (crows perched, picking at the scrow)
    [1] (lazily) I...thought I heard someone...mmm...thrashing about out there.
    [2] I didn't...mmm...realize...that it was you. It has been...quite some time.
    [3] You look as...delicious as ever.
    [4] Tell me, are you...[grunts]...eating well?
    [5] (yes - RANT)
    [6] (no) Oh, oh...hmm...well, that is...too bad. I hope for more...delectable feasts in your future.
[[SCARECROW 4]]
    grandstanding, magnanimous, self-absorbed, out of touch
    [1] Hellllo! How wonderful it is to see your shining face once again.
    [2] How long has it been? I am shocked that you could stay parted from me for so long! [hearty laugh]
    [3] No need to be shy! You are more than welcome to stay and bask in my radiant glow for as long as you like.
    [4] After all, I don't maintain this brilliant visage simply for my health! [hearty laugh]
    [5] (uncharacteristically tender) You...will stay a while, won't you?
    [6] (yes - RANT)
    [7] (no) Oh ho! As a matter of fact, I just remembered I have a pressing appointment I simply cannot miss. Though it stings my heart, we will have to have our tête-à-tête another time! Ta ta for now!
[[SCARECROW 5]]
    concerned, well-intentioned, manipulative, controlling
    [1] Hey! Are you feeling better?
    [2] I was thinking more about what we talked about last time.
    [3] I think you're just overthinking things.
    [4] Either way, I'm glad you came to me.
    [5] The other residents are a little...well, you know.
    [6] They don't know you like I do.
    [7] So, do you need more help?
    [8] (yes) Oh, dear, dear, of course. I will listen for as long as you need.
    [9] (no - RANT)
[[SCARECROW 6]]
    mischievous, generous, good-natured, carefree
    [1] Oh, just the person I was hoping to see today!
    [2] Just yesterday, I came up with a real gut-buster.
    [3] Okay, here we go: why don't scarecrows need to eat?
    [4] . . .
    [5] Because we're already stuffed! Ha ha ha!
    [6] What about you? Got a good joke for me?
    [7] (yes - RANT)
    [8] (no) Ah, no problem! It's hard to be as naturally funny as I am, after all, ha ha ha! Good to see you, have fun out there!
[[SCARECROW 7]]
    me
    [1] Hey! It's me, Jeff, the developer.
    [2] You're moving through the maze pretty well.
    [3] You'll probably be finished before long.
    [4] Anyway, just wanted to check in and say thanks for playing.
    [5] I'm a small-time game dev, so it means a lot that you took the time to play.
    [6] What do you think? Are you having fun so far?
    [7] (yes) Oh, great! I wasn't sure anyone besides me was going to like this game by the time it was finished. That means more than I can tell you, thank you. Enjoy the rest of the game!
    [8] (no) Ah, I'm sorry to hear it. If you want to duck out early, you can press the [quit keybind] key to quit. Otherwise, I hope it gets better from here.
[[SCARECROW 8]]
    austere, no-nonsense, supportive, indecisive
    [1] (brusquely) Welcome!
    [2] You're doing an adequate job traversing the maze.
    [3] No need to stop and chat with me.
    [4] Though...rest and hydration are both important as well.
    [5] So also feel free to take a break now and then!
    [6] (sheepishly) Uh...sorry. I'm still new at this.
    [7] It can be tough learning the ropes, don't you think?
    [8] (yes) Yes, you get it! Thanks for your support. Keep up the good work!
    [9] (no - RANT)
[[SCARECROW 9]]
    despondent, heartbroken, hopeful, desperate
    (dug up earth next to the scrow)
    [1] (angrily) Hey y- (disappointed) Oh. It's just you.
    [2] Ah, sorry, I don't mean it like that, it's just that, well...
    [3] I mean, you can see...they dug up Nell and took them away.
    [4] I just really miss them. (sniffs)
    [5] I know that's just how things go out here sometimes, but I can't help it.
    [6] Nell really was one-of-a-kind.
    [7] Do you think I'll see them again?
    [8] (yes - RANT)
    [9] (no) Right...well, all I can do is look to the future and hope for the best. Thanks for hearing me out.
[[SCARECROW 10]]
    inviting, teasing, irresponsible, fun-loving
    [1] Whoa, look who it is!
    [2] Great to see you - too bad the weather isn't better, huh?
    [3] Maybe we can do something about that... (sun moves to set behind)
    [4] There we go, that's much better. (giggle)
    [5] You're pretty close to the end now, but I'm glad you stopped to see me first.
    [6] How are you? Is everything okay?
    [7] (yes - RANT)
    [8] (no - RANT)

[[RANTS, GENERALLY SPEAKING]]
    1) passive-aggressive guilt trip - 'what, too good to do favors for your friends?'
    [X] 2) we shouldn't be pigeonholed into only doing the things we're good at
        people should have the autonomy to pursue what interests them
        there's nothing wrong with doing what you're good at either
        the pressure to be the best at what you do is artificial and dehumanizing
    [X] 3) there's nothing better than sharing a meal with friends and family
        it can be a crucial break from the fast-paced modern world
    [X] 4) you can have everything and still be lonely - don't be too proud
    [X] 5) manipulative breakdown - 'you're being selfish for not depending on me'
    6) spreading joy is a worthy endeavor, and can comfort you in times of trouble
    8) beware of hubris - talent can only get you so far
    9) those that are gone only leave us when we have forgotten them
        death is not the end, though it seems that way
        this doesn't keep loss from hurting, it just makes it more bearable
    10a) I'm proud of who you are
    10b) Keep your chin up - don't be afraid to ask for help
    A) hard work doesn't always pay off, and that's okay
    maybe i ought to start with the rants first, then work backwards...

    What are the themes I want to get across here? I'm concerned primarily with people's relationship to work, what they prioritize, and how they're empowered (or not) to do the things they love. With this in mind, maybe the investigations should be along these lines, using the scrows as stand-ins for workers:
        [1] Do the scrows have value to society outside of the labor they provide?
        [2] Should scrows have professional mobility? Do they have to scare crows, or can they paint? Write? Build houses?
        [3] How are the scrows compensated for their labor? Do they deserve more?
        ...is this stupid? Do I need a coherent voice? What would be the benefit of having a coherent voice? Maybe it would be better to leave it disparate, disconnected, and vague. I don't need to sell this game to anyone, so I don't need coherence. I just need genuine, chaotic writing. A walled labyrinth of stream-of-consciousness thought.

[[BARKS]]
    "I think I'm still somewhere near the entrance..."
    "I'm near the eastern wall right now"
    "I think I'm close to the northern edge of the maze"
    "This is the western wall, I think"
    "Looks like I'm getting to close to the exit now"
    "I'm near the center of the maze at this point"
    (specific barks for each scarecrow, letting the player know they're in the room or nearby, and whether the dialogue has been exhausted or not)

[[BRIEF METANARRATIVE OUTLINE]]
    Okay I really don't think I'm taking this route, but I did want to write down some of the ideas I had just in case.

    1) It is possible to play through the entire game without getting the metanarrative at all, as long as the game is played "as intended" (all scrow dialogue exhausted)

    2) Basically, if the player gets to a certain point in the maze, missing a scrow, the game will path or teleport them back to that scrow. I'll pop in as a narrator and say, 'oh, hey, i figure you probably didn't mean to miss this guy, so i'll just pop you back.' rinse and repeat this, getting increasingly frustrated each time. Eventually, "i" snap and say something along the lines of 'look, i need you to see all the work i put into this game. i need you to give it a good review so people see it and buy it.' bla bla bla.

[[MUSIC]]
    Got a nice little melody kinda planned out:
    https://www.beepbox.co/#8n31s0k0l00e01t18m0a7g0fj07i0r1o3210T0v2L4u86q1d4f9y0z9C0w6c0h3T5v0L4ue8q3d6f7y1z8C0c0h6H-SstrsrBzjAqihT1v1L4ucaq1d2f9y2z9C0c0A1F0B9VgQ2030Pef20E0181T2v1L4u15q0d1f8y0z1C2w0bcM000000000i0000000000000000000000000000000p21IFH-2Zd7wAs2hVhvB4th7Oy_a8WyeIzF8WyeAzIQvu4rcLp0bog2VKAurEJKyVKAurEJKyTubnoJKyRSa2VJvGGBH3E3oaHPrRRPBdVld0000

    The idea is to use the same basic melody so that it's familiar, then just change the instrument to denote where in the maze you are, or if you've already been there
